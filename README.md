## 💡 Why?

 Currently, in many situations, the lawyer is an essential agent for legal certainty in the modern world. it is very likely that you have already encountered problems or situations that made you need a lawyer. if it hasn't happened, inevitably, at some point it will.
 That´s because we may need a lawyer not only to solve problems (in the negative sense of the world), but also to have assistance, for example, in writing a contract or starting a business safely.
 So, with the help of a lawyer, you can solve or even avoid a problem, quickly and efficiently.
